# Backwards-incompatible changes from Fabric 0.1.0

In no particular order:

* Fab config file location used to be ~/.fabric; in the interests of honoring
Unix filename conventions it's now ~/.fabricrc
* The old Configuration class that 'env'/'ENV' was an instance of, has been
cleaned up, and its 'getAny()' method has been renamed to 'first()'.
* Additionally, that class apparently performed string interpolation -- with
itself as the mapping -- when setting values via e.g. 'env[key] = value'. This
didn't make much sense to me, so I've stripped it out for now. Simpler is
better.
* Internal variables such as 'fab_host' and 'fab_version' have been renamed to
simply 'host' and 'version' and so forth. This looks cleaner/more natural and
is less typing, and as long as we document them users should know not to
override them (just like regular Python and keywords/builtins, for example).
* Fabric version header is no longer printed every time the program runs; now
use the standard --version/-V options to print version and exit.
    * May add this behavior back in when Fab runs in some sort of verbose mode.
* The old internal 'about' command has been removed; other Unix programs don't
typically offer this. Users can always see the license and warranty info in
their respective text files distributed with the software.
