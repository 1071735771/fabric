# Backwards-incompatible changes from Fabric 0.0.*

In no particular order:

* Fab config file location used to be ~/.fabric; in the interests of Unix filename conventions it's now ~/.fabrc
* The old Configuration class that 'env'/'ENV' was an instance of, has been cleaned up, and its 'getAny()' method has been renamed to 'first()'.
* Additionally, that class apparently performed string interpolation -- with itself as the mapping -- when setting values via e.g. 'env[key] = value'. This didn't make much sense to me, so I've stripped it out for now.
