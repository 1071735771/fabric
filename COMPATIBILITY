# Backwards-incompatible changes from Fabric 0.1.* and earlier

In no particular order:

* Fabric no longer makes any attempt to be Python 2.4 compatible. It's painful,
but when rewritten it was simply too tempting to make use of the various tools
2.5 gives a developer: the `with` statement, the `all` and `any` builtin
methods, the `partition` string method, and many more.
    * Specifically, we're settling on a policy of supporting the most recent 2
    stable releases of Python 2.x, and that means 2.5 and 2.6 at the present
    time. Python 2.5 came out in 09/2006, which is pretty old at this point :)
    Furthermore, Debian stable -- always a good milestone for "old stuff" --
    recently came out with 2.5 on board.
    * If any users absolutely must have 2.4 support, we would welcome a
    semi-official standalone set of patches (or a Github fork) providing it,
    and might link to such code to make it easy to find. We would not,
    however, be able to actually support that version of the code.
* Fabric config file location used to be ~/.fabric; in the interests of honoring
Unix filename conventions it's now ~/.fabricrc
* The old Configuration class that 'env'/'ENV' was an instance of, has been
cleaned up, and its 'getAny()' method has been renamed to 'first()'.
* Additionally, that class apparently performed string interpolation -- with
itself as the mapping -- when setting values via e.g. 'env[key] = value'. This
didn't make much sense to me, so I've stripped it out for now. Simpler is
better.
* Internal variables such as 'fab_host' and 'fab_version' have been renamed to
simply 'host' and 'version' and so forth. This looks cleaner/more natural and
is less typing, and as long as we document them users should know not to
override them (just like regular Python and keywords/builtins, for example).
* Fabric version header is no longer printed every time the program runs; now
use the standard --version/-V options to print version and exit.
    * May add this behavior back in when Fab runs in some sort of verbose mode.
* The old internal 'about' command has been removed; other Unix programs don't
typically offer this. Users can always see the license and warranty info in
their respective text files distributed with the software.
* The old internal 'help' command is now the typical Unix options -h/--help.
    * Furthermore, there is no longer a listing of Fabric's programming API
    available through the command line -- those topics impact fabfile authors,
    not fab users (even though the former is a subset of the latter) and should
    stay in the documentation only.
