* See all TODO markings in source code
* Comprehensive test suite (using unittest? Nose? Mocking? etc?)
* Sphinx documentation
* Run lint/check type scripts to catch silly stuff like variables named
  'input' (i.e. accidental shadowing of builtins), unnecessary imports, etc.
* Make sure "constants" are consistently named: I've been trending towards not
  using ALL_CAPS, but in some places I probably did use them, so check and
  update.
