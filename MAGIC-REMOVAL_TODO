* See all TODO markings in source code
* Comprehensive test suite (using unittest? Nose? Mocking? etc?)
* Sphinx documentation
* Run lint/check type scripts to catch silly stuff like variables named
  'input' (i.e. accidental shadowing of builtins), unnecessary imports, etc.
* Make sure "constants" are consistently named: I've been trending towards not
  using ALL_CAPS, but in some places I probably did use them, so check and
  update.
* Possibly note in docs that callables imported into one's fabfile will show up
  as executable tasks; i.e. they'll clutter --list and can be invoked via
  command-line.
    * If we do note this for users, probably suggest the obvious: import
    modules instead of callables, and use module.callable instead.
    * Also good to note that they can take *advantage* of this to make
    "meta-fabfiles" collecting a number of sub-fabfiles' tasks into one
    user-facing presentation.
