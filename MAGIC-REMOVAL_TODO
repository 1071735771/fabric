* See all TODO markings in source code
* Comprehensive test suite (using unittest? Nose? Mocking? etc?)
* Sphinx documentation
* Run lint/check type scripts to catch silly stuff like variables named
  'input' (i.e. accidental shadowing of builtins), unnecessary imports, etc.
* Make sure "constants" are consistently named: I've been trending towards not
  using ALL_CAPS, but in some places I probably did use them, so check and
  update.
* Figure out if there's any nice way to not have --list display callables the user didn't define -- i.e. if one's fabfile does "from foo import some_function", I believe --list will currently print out some_function.
    * Perhaps we _should_ explicitly mark tasks, i.e. opt-in with a decorator or something? Not sure if it's worth going that far or not.
    * See if there is any actual way to look at an imported module and see what's defined in the module vs what was imported into that module from elsewhere. Like, introspect the function callables to see where they're defined; if that can be done in a non-icky way, might do the trick.
