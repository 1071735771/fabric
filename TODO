1   Ctrl-C dosn't quite work... especially not with the tail example
9   Allow for truly parallel execution (run on all hosts simultaneously)
13  Reduce print & exit() statements to as few functions as possible
15  Figure out a way to do plugins
    - SCM support should be done entirely in plugins
16  Get a better shell
26  Fix upload_website when new files are added
28  Grant more control over the output - e.g. hide 'run'/'sudo' lines
29  Allow more interactivity -- detect remote prompts and passthru to user
31  Figure out how to deal with the use of different @hosts lists when running
    more than one command in a single session.
33  When imported instead of ran via 'fab' (and/or controllable via option),
    raise an exception instead of calling sys.exit().
34  Put in optional (or default w/ option) timeouts for operations (or make
    sure existing network timeouts work correctly)
35  Figure out convenient way for users to set per-host passwords beforehand
36  Consider using or pulling ideas from path.py for easier path management
    - Paver uses it too
    - Lots of Smart People don't seem put off by its magic
    - Definitely feels Pythonic and would save typing
