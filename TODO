* Ctrl-C dosn't quite work... especially not with the tail example
* run, put, sudo et al. doesn't respect the 'fail' kvarg
* fab help, license & warranty tasks' not implemented
* README file
* AUTHORS file?
* fabfiles can't use global import statements
* need something like roles in Capistrano
* implement the release command in our fabfile so $fab clean release is all it
  takes
