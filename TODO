1   Ctrl-C dosn't quite work... especially not with the tail example
7   need something like roles in Capistrano
    - I'm thinking the ability to work with variable environments as first class
      objects
9   make parallel submode work
11  add built-in help for built-in variables
    - and modes and submodes
13  reduce print & exit() statements to as few functions as possible
14  also comment internal/private functions, if only a little
15  figure out a way to do plugins
    - SCM support should be done entirely in plugins
16  get a better shell
21  automated test suite
22  find alternative to the deprecated 'execfile()'
    - compile() + eval() makes a combo worth considering (if it works in py3k).
24  add escaping to _lazy_format
25  turn fabric the module, into fabric the package
26  fix upload_website when new files are added
27  Allow override of fab_shell (or just the shell location) per host
    - so edge cases like stock OBSD, which lack bash, can be targeted.
28  Grant more control over the output - e.g. hide 'run'/'sudo' lines
29  Allow more interactivity -- detect remote prompts and passthru to user
