1   Ctrl-C dosn't quite work... especially not with the tail example
2   run, put, sudo et al. doesn't respect the 'fail' kvarg
5   AUTHORS file?
6   fabfiles can't use global import statements
    - some work has been done on this... needs testing
7   need something like roles in Capistrano
    - I'm thinking the ability to work with variable environments as first class
      objects
9   make fanout mode work
10  when an operation fails, fabric doesn't break and exit
    - no longer true for local operations
11  add built-in help for built-in variables
12  allow run & sudo to save the output of stdout and stderr in variables
13  reduce print & exit() statements to as few functions as possible
14  also comment internal/private functions, if only a little
15  figure out a way to do plugins
    - SCM support should be done entirely in plugins
16  get a better shell
17  a web site for the project with online documentation
18  make local_per_host() adhere to the provided fab_mode
    - preferably by using _on_hosts_do, or something
21  automated test suite
22  find alternative to the deprecated 'execfile()'
