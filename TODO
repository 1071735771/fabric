* Ctrl-C dosn't quite work... especially not with the tail example
* run, put, sudo et al. doesn't respect the 'fail' kvarg
* fab help, license & warranty commands not implemented
* README file
* AUTHORS file?
* fabfiles can't use global import statements
* need something like roles in Capistrano
* implement the release command in our fabfile so 'fab clean release' is all it
  takes
* make fanout mode work
* when an operation fails, fabric doesn't break and exit
* add built-in help for built-in variables
* allow run & sudo to save the output of stdout and stderr in variables
