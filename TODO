* Ctrl-C dosn't quite work... especially not with the tail example
* run, put, sudo et al. doesn't respect the 'fail' kvarg
* fab help, the standard default help message
* README file
* AUTHORS file?
* fabfiles can't use global import statements
  - some work has been done on this... needs testing
* need something like roles in Capistrano
  - I'm thinking the ability to work with variable environments as first class
    objects
* implement the release command in our fabfile so 'fab clean release' is all it
  takes
* make fanout mode work
* when an operation fails, fabric doesn't break and exit
* add built-in help for built-in variables
* allow run & sudo to save the output of stdout and stderr in variables
* reduce print % exit() statements to as few functions as possible
* also comment internal/private functions, if only a little
* figure out a way to do plugins
  - SCM support should be done entirely in plugins
* get a better shell
