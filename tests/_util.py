    Mock & expect one or more remote connections & command executions.

    With no parameterization (``@mock_remote``) or empty parameterization
    (``@mock_remote()``) a single default connection+execution is implied, i.e,
    equivalent to ``@mock_remote(Session())``.

    When parameterized, takes `.Session` objects (see warning below about
    ordering).

    .. warning::
        Due to ``SSHClient``'s API, we must expect connections in the order
        that they are made. If you run into failures caused by explicitly
        expecting hosts in this manner, **make sure** the order of sessions
        and commands you're giving ``@mock_remote`` matches the order in
        which the code under test is creating new ``SSHClient`` objects!

    The wrapped test function must accept a positional argument for each
    command in ``*sessions``, which are used to hand in the mock channel
    objects that are created (so that the test function may make asserts with
    them).

    .. note::
        The actual logic involved is a flattening of all commands across the
        sessions, to make accessing them within the tests fast and easy. E.g.
        in this test setup::

            @mock_remote(
                Session(Command('whoami'), Command('uname')),
                Session(host='foo', cmd='ls /'),

            @mock_remote(...)
            def mytest(self, chan_whoami, chan_uname, chan_ls):
                pass

        Most of the time, however, there is a 1:1 map between session and
        command, making this straightforward.
