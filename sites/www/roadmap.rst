===================
Development roadmap
===================

This document outlines Fabric's intended development path. Please make sure
you're reading `the latest version <http://fabfile.org/roadmap.html>`_ of this
document, and also see the page about :ref:`upgrading <upgrading>` if you are
migrating from version 1 to versions 2 or above.

Fabric 2 and above
==================

Modern Fabric versions (2+) receive active feature development. At the present
time, version 2 has only recently been released and we are still porting some
functionality present in 1.x that was not part of 2.0. (See :ref:`upgrading`
for feature-by-feature status info.)

Versions 3, 4 and so forth will consist of small sets of backwards
incompatible changes to the 2.x codebase, and will not be long-period full
rewrites as the 1 to 2 process was.

Fabric 1.x
==========

Fabric 1.x has reached a tipping point regarding internal tech debt & ability
to make significant improvements without harming backwards compatibility. As
such, the 1.x line now receives bugfixes only. We **strongly** encourage all
users to :ref:`upgrade <upgrading>` to Fabric 2.x.
