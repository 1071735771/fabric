Hacking Fabric: Modus Operandi
==============================

So you want to hack on Fabric? And there's a chance you might want to share
your changes? Then read on; this document is written specifically for you.

This document is not about where which parts are located in the code. Rather,
this document is about process and conventions.

There are essentially five things (besides python programming) you need to
know, in order to work on, and make changes to, Fabric:

1. Where to get the source code
2. Where to put your changes
3. How we prefer to structure and style code
4. How we prefer to organize SCM history
5. Where the community's at

Apart from that, don't be afraid to ask the mailing list if you are ever in
doubt or confused by any of this.


Where to get the source code
----------------------------

Assuming you want to make changes to it and have them possibly merged upstream,
then the *best* way to get started, is to get an account on [github][github]
and make a fork of [the Fabric repository][gh-repo].
