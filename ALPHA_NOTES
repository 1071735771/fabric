Scratchpad for stuff to say about the alpha and recording feedback about same
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Execution model: see "Make execution model more robust/flexible" bullet near
  bottom of MAGIC-REMOVAL_TODO. Want people's thoughts on how they do or would
  like to structure their fabfiles, in terms of execution order, and what host
  lists should apply when.
* Module layout: general feedback appreciated here. Make sense as-is?
* Did I forget anything, or is anything I explicitly removed something that is
  still necessary?
