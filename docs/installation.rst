============
Installation
============

* Manually (unpack .tgz into site-packages)
* easy_install (final releases only)
* pip (final releases, or point to git repository for dev work)
    * pip + requirements.txt -- we will provide requirements.txt files for both "user" and "developer" profiles (the latter includes the extra dependencies for testing, mocking, doc building and etc)
