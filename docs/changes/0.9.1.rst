========================
Changes in version 0.9.1
========================

The following changes were implemented in Fabric 0.9.1:

Feature additions
=================

* None.

Bugfixes
========

* :issue:`75`: ``fab``, when called with no arguments or (useful) options, now
  prints help, even when no fabfile can be found. Previously, calling ``fab``
  in a location with no fabfile would complain about the lack of fabfile
  instead of displaying help.


Documentation updates
=====================

* A number of minor documentation tweaks which had no specific Redmine ticket
  associated with them.
* :issue:`127`: Added note to install docs
  re: ActiveState's PyPM. Thanks to Sridhar Ratnakumar for the tip. 
* :issue:`120`: Tweaked documentation, help strings to make it more obvious
  that fabfiles are simply Python modules.
* :issue:`17`: Added note to FAQ re: use of ``dtach`` as alternative to
  ``screen``. Thanks to Erich Heine for the tip.
* :issue:`64`: Updated docs to clarify where package maintainers should be
  downloading tarballs from. Thanks to James Pearson for providing the
  necessary perspective.
