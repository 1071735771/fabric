========================

The following changes were implemented in Fabric 0.9.1:

* :issue:`127`: Added note to install docs
  re: ActiveState's PyPM. Thanks to Sridhar Ratnakumar for the tip. 
* :issue:`120`: Tweaked documentation, help strings to make it more obvious
  that fabfiles are simply Python modules.
