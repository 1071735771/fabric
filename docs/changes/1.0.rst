Changes in version 1.0
======================

This page lists all significant changes made between versions 0.9 and 1.0 of
Fabric.

* `~fabric.contrib.files.contains` and `~fabric.contrib.files.append`
  previously had the ``filename`` argument in the second position, whereas all
  other functions in the module had ``filename`` as the first argument. In 1.0,
  these two functions were brought in line with the rest of
  `~fabric.contrib.files`.
* `~fabric.operations.sudo`'s signature used to be ``sudo(command, shell, user,
  pty)``; to be consistent with `~fabric.operations.run`, the last two kwargs
  have been swapped: its signature is now ``sudo(command, shell, pty, user)``.
* The `~fabric.operations.reboot` operation has been added, providing a way for
  Fabric to issue a reboot command and then reconnect after the system has
  restarted.
* Added a `~fabric.utils.fastprint` utility function equivalent to
  ``sys.stdout.write(text); sys.stdout.flush()``.
