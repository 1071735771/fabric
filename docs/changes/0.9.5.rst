Bugfixes
========

* :issue:`37`: Internal refactoring of a Paramiko call from ``_transport`` to
  ``get_transport()``.
* :issue:`258`: Modify subprocess call on Windows platforms to avoid
  space/quote problems in `~fabric.operations.local`. Thanks to Henrik
  Heimbuerger and Raymond Cote for catch + suggested fixes.
* :issue:`261`: Fix bug in `~fabric.contrib.files.comment` which truncated
  regexen ending with ``$``. Thanks to Antti Kaihola for the catch.
* :issue:`264`: Fix edge case in `~fabric.operations.reboot` by gracefully
  clearing connection cache. Thanks to Jason Gerry for the report &
  troubleshooting.
* :issue:`268`: Allow for ``@`` symbols in usernames, which is valid on some

  last ``@`` found instead of the first. Thanks to Thadeus Burgess for the
  report.

  Thanks to Antti Kaihola for the catch and Rick Harding for testing the
  proposed solution.
