Changes in version 0.9.2
========================

The following changes were implemented in Fabric 0.9.2:

Feature additions
=================

* The `~fabric.operations.reboot` operation has been added, providing a way for
  Fabric to issue a reboot command and then reconnect after the system has
  restarted.
* ``python setup.py test`` now runs Fabric's test suite (provided you have all
  the prerequisites from the ``requirements.txt`` installed). Thanks to Eric
  Holscher for the patch.
* Added functionality for loading fabfiles which are Python packages
  (directories) instead of just modules (single files.) See
  :ref:`fabfile-discovery`.
* Added output lines informing the user of which tasks are being executed (e.g.
  ``[myserver] Executing task 'foo'``.)
* Added support for lazy (callable) role definition values in ``env.roledefs``.
* Added `contrib.django <fabric.contrib.django>` module with basic Django
  integration.
* :ref:`env.local_user <local-user>` was added, providing easy and permanent
  access to the local system username, even if an alternate remote username has
  been specified.
* :issue:`29`: Added support for arbitrary command-line-driven anonymous tasks
  via ``fab [options] -- [shell command]``. See :ref:`arbitrary-commands`.
* :issue:`151`: Added a `~fabric.utils.puts` utility function, which allows
  greater control over fabfile-generated (as opposed to Fabric-generated)
  output. Also added `~fabric.utils.fastprint`, an alias to
  `~fabric.utils.puts` allowing for convenient unbuffered,
  non-newline-terminated printing.


Bugfixes
========

* :issue:`123`: Removed Cygwin from the "are we on Windows" test; now, only
  Python installs whose ``sys.platform`` says ``'win32'`` will use Windows-only
  code paths (e.g. importing of ``pywin32``).


Documentation updates
=====================

* Added a few new items to the :doc:`FAQ </faq>`.
* :issue:`173`: Simple but rather embarrassing typo fix in README. Thanks to
  Ted Nyman for the catch.
* :issue:`194`: Added a note to :doc:`the install docs </installation>` about a
  possible edge case some Windows 64-bit Python users may encounter.
