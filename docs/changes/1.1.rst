Documentation updates
=====================

* :issue:`184`: Make the usage of `~fabric.contrib.project.rsync_project`'s
  ``local_dir`` argument more obvious, regarding its use in the ``rsync`` call.
  (Specifically, so users know they can pass in multiple, space-joined
  directory names instead of just one single directory.)

* :issue:`314`: Test utility decorator improvements. Thanks to Rick Harding for
  initial catch & patch.
* :issue:`307`: A whole pile of minor PEP8 tweaks. Thanks to Markus Gattol for
