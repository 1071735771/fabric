Changes in version 1.1
======================

This page lists all changes made to Fabric in its 1.1.0 release.


Feature additions
=================

* :issue:`10`: `~fabric.contrib.upload_project` now allows control over the
  local and remote directory paths, and has improved error handling. Thanks to
  Rodrigue Alcazar for the patch.
* :issue:`107`: `~fabric.operations.require`'s ``provided_by`` kwarg now
  accepts iterables in addition to single values. Thanks to Thomas Ballinger
  for the patch.
* :issue:`117`: `~fabric.contrib.files.upload_template` now supports the
  `~fabric.operations.put` flags ``mirror_local_mode`` and ``mode``. Thanks to
  Joe Stump for the suggestion and Thomas Ballinger for the patch.
* :issue:`154`: `~fabric.contrib.files.sed` now allows customized regex flags
  to be specified via a new ``flags`` parameter. Thanks to Nick Trew for the
  suggestion and Morgan Goose for initial implementation.
* :issue:`170`: Allow :ref:`exclusion <excluding-hosts>` of specific hosts from
  the final run list. Thanks to Casey Banner for the suggestion and patch.
* :issue:`273`: `~fabric.contrib.files.upload_template` now offers control over
  whether it attempts to create backups of pre-existing destination files.
  Thanks to Ales Zoulek for the suggestion and initial patch.

Bugfixes
========

* :issue:`115`: An implementation detail causing host lists to lose order
  when deduped by the ``fab`` execution loop, has been patched to preserve
  order instead. So e.g. ``fab -H a,b,c`` (or setting ``env.hosts = ['a', 'b',
  'c']``) will now always run on ``a``, then ``b``, then ``c``. Previously,
  there was a chance the order could get mixed up during deduplication. Thanks
  to Rohit Aggarwal for the report.

Documentation updates
=====================

* :issue:`184`: Make the usage of `~fabric.contrib.project.rsync_project`'s
  ``local_dir`` argument more obvious, regarding its use in the ``rsync`` call.
  (Specifically, so users know they can pass in multiple, space-joined
  directory names instead of just one single directory.)

Internals
=========

* :issue:`307`: A whole pile of minor PEP8 tweaks. Thanks to Markus Gattol for
  highlighting the ``pep8`` tool and to Rick Harding for the patch.
* :issue:`314`: Test utility decorator improvements. Thanks to Rick Harding for
  initial catch & patch.
