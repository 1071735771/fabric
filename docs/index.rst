Download
========

Latest stable version
---------------------

The most recent stable version of Fabric is |version| and may be downloaded
from the :doc:`downloads` page, which also contains previous versions as well
as installation instructions.

Development version
-------------------

We recommend using the stable version of Fabric; releases are made often to
prevent any large gaps in functionality between the latest stable release and
the development version.

However, if you want to live on the edge, you can pull down the latest source
code from our Git repository, or fork us on Github. Please see the
:doc:`development` page for details.


Getting help
============

Mailing list
------------

The best way to get help with using Fabric is via the `fab-user mailing list
<http://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/fab-user>`_ (currently hosted at
``nongnu.org``.) The Fabric developers do their best to reply promptly, and the
list contains an active community of other Fabric users and contributors as
well.

Bugs
----

Fabric has no official bug tracker at this point in time, but getting one is
very high on our priority list, so keep an eye out! For the time being, please
submit bug reports via the mailing list (see above) or e-mail the development
team directly at ``developers [at] fabfile [dot] org``.

.. note:: Using the mailing list is preferred -- it increases your chances of
    getting prompt feedback, and also allows other users to confirm your bug
    report and thus give it a higher priority.
