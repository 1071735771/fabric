h1. Source code

The Fabric source code is kept under version control by "Git":git.or.cz/.

The official main-line git repository is located at
git://git.savannah.nongnu.org/fab.git and you can browse the source online
here: http://git.savannah.nongnu.org/gitweb/?p=fab.git.

There's also a repository at Github located here:
http://github.com/karmazilla/fabric/tree/master

Changes to the master branches are mirrored between these two repositories.

h2. Getting the source

If you have a Github account, then you just press the 'fork' button and off
you go.

If you want to get the code from the nongnu.org repository, then you can do
so by running this command in a terminal:

bc. $ git clone git://git.savannah.nongnu.org/fab.git

h2. Using Git

The Internets are full documentation on how to use Git. One of my favorites
is this one: http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/everyday.html
